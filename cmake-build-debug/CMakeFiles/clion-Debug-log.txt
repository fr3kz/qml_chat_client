-- Could NOT find Qt6WebSockets (missing: Qt6WebSockets_DIR)
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    /Users/artur/Qt/6.6.1/macos/lib/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake

  but it set Qt6_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6" is considered to be NOT
  FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Failed to find required Qt component "WebSockets".

  Expected Config file at
  "/Users/artur/Qt/6.6.1/macos/lib/cmake/Qt6WebSockets/Qt6WebSocketsConfig.cmake"
  does NOT exist



  Configuring with --debug-find-pkg=Qt6WebSockets might reveal details why
  the package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.



-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
